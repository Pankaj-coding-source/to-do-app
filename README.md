# 📝 Todo App

A simple **Todo App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to add, display, and remove todos, with persistence using **localStorage**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new todos via an input form.
- Display todos dynamically on the page.
- Remove todos with a ❌ button.
- Data persistence using **localStorage** (todos remain after page reload).
- Lightweight and dependency-free (no external libraries).

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. On page load, the app checks if there are any todos stored in `localStorage`.
2. If found, they are displayed automatically.
3. Users can:
   - Enter a todo in the input field and submit.
   - See the todo added to the list immediately.
   - Remove a todo by clicking the ❌ button.
4. The list is updated in `localStorage` after every change.

## 📸 Demo
Example workflow:

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add **edit functionality** for todos.
- Add **completion status** (mark as done).
- Add **filtering** (show all, completed, pending).
- Improve UI with CSS styling.
